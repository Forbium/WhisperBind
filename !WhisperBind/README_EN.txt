This addon was written by Forbium and Rogolist.
The Whisper Bind addon is written so that you can whisper to a specific player by pressing buttons without occupying
a separate slot for the macro.

Usage.
To configure whispering, you need to go to the addon settings by clicking on the “settings” button, it will open a
window where there will be three columns with fields. In the first column we write what we want the button to be called
(to make it easy to find), in the second, who we want to send the message to, and in the third, what kind of message we
want to send. After completing the settings, you need to click the “save” button and you can close the settings window.
Now the next time your account is launched, you will not need to enter this information into the settings, it will be
automatically loaded.

Well suited for the Whispercast addon if you do not need to send many different messages.
If the window goes beyond the screen, you need to write the command /run interface:SetPoint("TOPLEFT",600,-200);.
This will bring the window to the center of the screen.
